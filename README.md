# Wesnoth Companion App
An Android application based on the game “The Battle for Wesnoth” for Human Computer Interaction project.

### Idea
The idea was to make an Android application that could complete the game
experience in mobility. The aim of the application was to implement some aspects of the game that could be 
important to see when the player is far from PC.

The project's aim was to build a prototype of a companion app.

The development of the software was made following all the steps of 
Human Computer Interaction: **Needfinding**, **Implementation** and **Usability Test**.

The app is native Android and it's Java only.

You can download the **apk** from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12Tm2x7RB4jRTWdUQuTOb91rGsO2_0Enc&export=download).

## Application
For a more pleasant interaction, the implementation follows the [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) guide-lines.

## Usability test
Usability is about testing the app to evaluate the functionality of the
prototype.
The testers are the same persons interviewed in the needfinding phase.

The test was made by 2 step:
* a first step where the tester were free to use the app like they wanted;
* and a scripted test where the tester had to satisfy some goals.

The results are shown in the figure below:
